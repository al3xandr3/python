# Python Utils

Collection of  python util scripts.

Some are scripts to execute directly, other to be used as libs.

To reach the libs, use:

```python
>>> import sys; import os; sys.path.append(os.path.expanduser('~/DropBox/my/projects/python/'))
```

(update the python script directory to your own path)
